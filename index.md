## ELIXIR Reproducible Research Workshop: Bioinformatics Workflow Management 2021
## Monday 29th November - Wednesday 1st December 2021
## This event will be live streamed on twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/elixir_workshops/

Reproducibility is a cornerstone of good scientific practice. Thanks to funding provided by ELIXIR Training Platform Task 2, we have brought together the biggest names in bioinformatics workflow management for a 3 day practical workshop. We have presentations from the development teams of CWL, Snakemake, Nextflow, nf-core and more. If you want to learn more about the workflow management concepts that will be addressed in this workshop, check out these articles:

## Details

**Organizers**: 
- [Naveed Ishaque, *Berlin Institute of Health at Charité University Hospital*](naveed.ishaque@charite.de)
- Sina Barysch, *EMBL*
- Franziska Mueller, *Berlin Institute of Health at Charité University Hospital*
- Daniel Wibberg, *CeBiTec, Univerity of Bielefeld*

**Target audience:** PhD/postdoc-level bioinformaticians familiar with omics analysis and scripting in python/R. You should already be familiar with some data analysis workflows and ready to take your first steps in trying out a modern workflow management tool.

**Places:** 30 attendees - apply soon to avoid disappointment!

**Location: virtual via Zoom**. The practical sessions will require use of your own laptop, HPC etc. **You will need access to a linux terminal**. Please note that you will be expected to set up software environments for the practical sessions before hand. Details on how to do this will be provided in due course.

**Dates:** Monday 29th November – Wednesday 1st December.
